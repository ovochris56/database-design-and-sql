📁Database Design and SQL

Repository for coursework and projects from  my **Database Design and SQL course (HI520)** at Purdue University Global.

📖Course Description 

This course covers fundamental database design topics in a health care context, including data modeling, entity-relationship diagrams, the top-down database design methodology, the bottomup database design methodology, functional dependencies, and the normalization process. You will learn about Structured Query Language (SQL), which is used to retrieve and modify health
care-related data in relational databases. This course emphasizes designing queries for optimum performance and using query execution plans as a tool for creating appropriate indexes to improve query performance.

🎯Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will develop the following skills:

✅ HI520-1: Interpret data modeling concepts and normalized entity-relationship (ER) diagrams in healthcare database design.

✅ HI520-2: Utilize a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for effective database installation and manipulation.

✅ HI520-3: Design Structured Query Language (SQL) queries and syntax for healthcare database information analysis.

✅ HI520-4: Create Structured Query Language (SQL) for advanced queries and reports.
