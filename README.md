📁Database Design and SQL

📌Overview

Repository for coursework and projects from  my **Database Design and SQL course (HI520)** at Purdue University Global.

This project demonstrates relational database design and SQL querying using SQL Studio. It focuses on creating an efficient schema, normalizing data, and performing queries to retrieve meaningful insights. The database models a healthcare scenario using sample data, ensuring data integrity and optimized performance. It focuses on:

  - Creating an efficient schema with normalized tables.
  - Executing queries to retrieve meaningful insights.
  - Implementing relationships between tables and foreign keys.
    
📖Course Description 

This course covers fundamental database design topics in a health care context, including data modeling, entity-relationship diagrams, the top-down database design methodology, the bottomup database design methodology, functional dependencies, and the normalization process. You will learn about Structured Query Language (SQL), which is used to retrieve and modify health
care-related data in relational databases. This course emphasizes designing queries for optimum performance and using query execution plans as a tool for creating appropriate indexes to improve query performance.

🎯Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will develop the following skills:

✅ HI520-1: Interpret data modeling concepts and normalized entity-relationship (ER) diagrams in healthcare database design.

✅ HI520-2: Utilize a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for effective database installation and manipulation.

✅ HI520-3: Design Structured Query Language (SQL) queries and syntax for healthcare database information analysis.

✅ HI520-4: Create Structured Query Language (SQL) for advanced queries and reports.

✅ PC-3.1: Conduct oneself to reflect the professional characteristics and culture of a given work setting.
